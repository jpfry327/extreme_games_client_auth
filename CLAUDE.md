```

Run a single test file: `npx vitest run src/sim/sim.test.ts`

## Architecture

Read `docs/architecture.md` for the full contract. Every feature must fit the four-layer model before being written.

### The golden rule

**`src/sim/` is pure game logic — no Pixi, no DOM, no `Math.random()`.**  
The same sim code runs on the browser client and the Node headless server. Any import of `pixi.js` or DOM APIs in `sim/` breaks this.

### The four layers

| Layer | Where | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Sim state** (`sim/types.ts`) | Server-authoritative | Plain, JSON-serializable data. No methods. |
| **B — Sim systems** (`sim/systems/`, `sim/world.ts`) | Server | Pure `(world, ctx) → void` functions. No I/O. No randomness outside `world.rng`. |
| **C — Events** (`world.events`) | Server → client | Transient, fire-and-forget, drained each frame. Never stored in snapshots. |
| **D — Client** (`render/`, `input/`, future `ui/`, `audio/`) | Client only | Reads Layer A + drains Layer C. Never mutates sim state directly; sends `InputCommand`s instead. |

### Tick pipeline

`World.step()` runs at a fixed **100Hz**. It is an explicitly ordered list of systems — the order is a design decision, not an implementation detail:

```
1. intent       2. movement     3. firing       4. items
5. projectiles  6. collision    7. damage       8. death/respawn
9. status       10. resources   11. prizes      12. objectives
13. regions     14. (events accumulated → client drains)
```

Steps 7–8 (damage / death / respawn) are the keystone for all competitive features.

### Data model highlights

- `World.players: Map<PlayerId, Player>` — never a singleton `ship`.
- `Player` is grouped components: `kinematics`, `resources`, `loadout`, `status`, `combat`.
- `Projectile` carries a stable server-assigned `id` for snapshot diffing.
- `world.events: GameEvent[]` — produced by systems, drained by the renderer and audio each frame.
- `world.rng` — seeded deterministic RNG; never `Math.random()` in sim. Determinism is a hard requirement for client-side prediction.

### Config

`src/config.ts` is the source of truth for every tunable gameplay number, ported from `original_data/extreme_games_config.ini`. The file documents unit conversions. Config grows into `SHIPS: Record<ShipType, ShipConfig>` tables as the 8 ships are added (M4).

### Networking shape (`src/net/`)

Three wire message types. Control/input is JSON text; snapshots are a **binary,
delta-compressed** frame as of M2.13 (see Current milestone status):
1. **`InputCommand`** (client → server) — player intent; never state. JSON.
2. **`Snapshot`** (server → client) — serialized Layer A state. Because Layer A is plain data, the snapshot essentially *is* the world. Sent as a binary delta against the client's acked baseline (`net/snapshotCodec.ts`); the loopback path still passes the plain object.
3. **`GameEvent[]`** (server → client) — Layer C, for effects/audio/kill-feed (carried in the snapshot frame).

`Transport` is an interface (`src/net/transport.ts`); `LoopbackTransport` and `WebSocketTransport` are interchangeable implementations. Swapping them is a one-line change in `main.ts`.

Snapshots are **per-client** (`serializeSnapshotFor(world, playerId)`), which is where stealth/AOI culling will live. Build this seam per-client even when first version sends everyone everything.

### Render / interpolation

- `FixedLoop` in `sim/loop.ts` accumulates real elapsed time and drives exact 10ms sim steps.
- The renderer runs per `requestAnimationFrame`, interpolating between `prevX/prevY/prevRotation` (previous tick) and current state using the leftover `alpha`.
- For remote players under the multiplayer transport, this same mechanism extends to interpolating between buffered server snapshots with `interpDelay` (~100ms).

## Current milestone status

### ⚑ Pivot: client-authoritative ("defender authority") relay model

The project has **pivoted from server-authoritative netcode to the original Subspace
client-authoritative model** (the roadmap's post-M2.12 decision gate). **If you die on
your own screen, that is authoritative.** Each node runs an authoritative sim **only for
the players it owns**: a client owns its local ship; the server owns its bot. The server
is a **mirror + scoreboard relay** — it ingests each client's state, runs only its bot,
scores deaths, and broadcasts the unchanged per-client binary delta snapshots.

**The core inversion:** the client now sends **state, not intent** (`StateReportMsg`),
inverting architecture.md §5's "client sends intent" rule for humans. Anti-cheat is
**explicitly deferred** — this model is trivially cheatable by design (accepted).

Key pieces:
- **`sim/world.ts`** — `World.defends: Set<PlayerId> | null` (null = all, legacy) +
  `scoresKills` gate which players a world simulates/kills and whether it credits kills.
  `movement`/`firing`/`collision`/`damage`/`death`/`respawn` all skip non-defended players.
- **`net/localSim.ts`** (`LocalSim`) — the authoritative self-simulator used by **both**
  the client (for the human) and the server (for the bot). Free-runs at 100Hz; injects
  incoming remote shots and adjudicates them against the owned ship at the **present**
  (favour the defender — no lag comp).
- **`net/relayHost.ts`** (`RelayHost`) — server mirror + bot defender + scoreboard, shared
  by `net/server.ts` (loopback) and `server/index.ts` (WebSocket). Merges client reports
  (preserving server-owned kills/score), scores the bot's death inline and human deaths
  from `DeathReportMsg` ("defender names the killer", deduped by death count), and assembles
  snapshots (projectile ids namespaced per owner).
- **`net/protocol.ts`** — `StateReportMsg` (replaces `InputMsg`), `DeathReportMsg`,
  `WelcomeMsg` carries the server-assigned spawn. `net/reportSender.ts` paces the uplink.
- **Retired:** client prediction/reconciliation (`prediction.ts`, `reconciliationSmoother.ts`),
  input streaming (`clientInput.ts`, `inputSender.ts`, `serverInput.ts`), predicted-hit cosmetics
  (`predictedHits.ts`), and **all lag compensation** (`history.ts`, `compTicks`, `renderTick`,
  `LAGCOMP`, the collision/bomb rewind branches) — the defender decides at the present.

The KEPT downstream stack (binary delta codec, per-client AOI, entity interpolation,
`RemoteProjectileSimulator`) is **unchanged** — only the *source* of snapshot rows moved
from `world.step()` to client reports.

---

The standard server-authoritative netcode model (M2.0–M2.15) below is the *pre-pivot*
history (it still describes the kept snapshot/AOI/interpolation machinery; the
prediction/lag-comp parts are now retired per the pivot above).

Per `docs/roadmap.md`, the full standard netcode model (M2.0–M2.10) is complete, and
the M2.11+ responsiveness/efficiency pass is underway. The sequence is:
```
M0 ✓ → M1 ✓ → M2.0–M2.10 ✓ (full netcode model)
     → M2.11 ✓ (measure & tune) → M2.12 ✗ (UDP transport — SKIPPED) → M2.13 ✓ binary+delta
     → M2.14 ✓ AOI culling (stealth deferred to M5) → M2.15 ✓ input batching → M3 (UI) → ...
```

M2.14 fills the per-client `serializeSnapshotFor` seam: each client is sent only entities within
its area of interest (`net/aoi.ts` — a rectangular viewport expanded by `weaponReach`, Subspace's
`max(WeaponRange, screen)` rule as one AABB), always including self + own shots. `config.AOI` holds
the tunables (`weaponReach` derived from `SHIPS`). Because content now differs per client, the
`SnapshotChannel` baseline ring became **per-client**: each client keeps its own ring of the
*filtered* quantized snapshots it was sent, so a delta diffs against exactly what that client holds
— an entity leaving AOI is a normal delta removal (clean despawn), one re-entering is a full-entity
add, and a `hysteresisPx` band stops boundary flicker. The shared world is still quantized once per
broadcast. **Stealth/cloak concealment is deferred to M5**, which plugs into a single marked
predicate in `filterSnapshotFor` without touching the baseline machinery.

The three legs of the model: **client prediction** (own ship/shots at present — M2.4/M2.6),
**entity interpolation** (remotes smoothed in the past — M2.2/M2.8), and **lag compensation**
(server rewinds targets to the firer's view — M2.9).

M2.9 makes a shot that *visually connects* on the firer's screen actually register, fixing
"eaten bombs" (a remote ship is drawn ~`interpDelayMs` in the past, but collision tested the
present, so shots sailed through the drawn ghost). The pieces:
- **`sim/history.ts`** (`TickHistory`): a runtime-only `world.history` ring (`LAGCOMP.historyTicks`
  = 120t) of each player's `{x, y, radius, alive}`, recorded at the end of every `World.step()`.
  Never serialized — only the authoritative server accrues it.
- **`InputCommand.renderTick`**: the server tick the client's render view corresponded to when it
  sampled the command (`SnapshotInterpolator.renderTick()`, stamped in `main.ts`). The rewind rides
  *in the input*, so the server stays a pure function of its inputs — determinism holds.
- **`Projectile.compTicks`**: `firingSystem` stamps `spawnTick − renderTick` (clamped to
  `LAGCOMP.maxCompTicks` = 25t = 250ms and the history length) onto each shot; it carries for the
  shot's whole life so every flight-tick `collisionSystem` overlap test reaches `compTicks` into the
  past. The shot still *flies* in the present; only the *overlap test* rewinds.
- **Scope:** both projectile *direct-hit* detection (`collisionSystem`) and bomb *splash*
  (`detonateBomb`) are lag-compensated to the shot's `compTicks` — the splash had to be, since a
  Subspace bomb does all its damage via splash and a present-based blast on the ghost does ~zero
  damage to a mover. Hits/damage stay 100% server-authoritative — no predicted kills, no rollback of
  consequences. `ShipHitEvent.rewound` flags rewind hits.

The netcode debug overlay is at M2.11. Alongside the M2.5 `smooth off Npx` / `netsim …` and
M2.9 `lagcomp Nt (~Nms) rewind hits N` lines, it has a **link-health** block: snapshot
interval + jitter, the live→target adaptive interp delay and buffer depth, and per-second
rates for snapshot loss/stale and extrapolation/freeze/comp-clamp events. `compTicks` shows
`CLAMPED` when the desired rewind exceeds `LAGCOMP.maxCompTicks` (shots under-compensated).

M2.11 also: **raised `LAGCOMP.maxCompTicks` 15t→25t (250ms)** so a ~100ms-RTT shot's full view
delay (`interpDelayMs` + RTT ≈ 175ms) is covered rather than clamped (the "bombs hit but don't
register" bug); **made the interpolation delay adaptive** (`net/adaptiveInterp.ts`, driven by
`net/netHealth.ts`) so a jittery link stops starving the buffer; and reconciled the
broadcast-rate doc drift (~33Hz, not 20Hz).

M2.13 replaces the JSON snapshot on the WebSocket data plane with a **binary, field-level
delta** codec (M2.12 UDP was skipped). The seam is unchanged: the server still builds a plain
`Snapshot` (Layer A); `net/snapshotCodec.ts` encodes it to bytes and the client decodes it back
to the identical shape, so the interpolator/predictor/renderer are untouched. The loopback
`GameServer` still passes the plain object — binary is purely the wire form. Pieces:
- **`net/byteBuffer.ts`** — `ByteWriter`/`ByteReader` primitives (LEB128 varint, f32, bool,
  string). `writeVaruint` throws on a non-finite value (a bullet's `bounces` is `Infinity`,
  which would otherwise loop forever); the `bounces` field uses a dedicated `varinf` kind that
  round-trips `Infinity`.
- **`net/snapshotCodec.ts`** — a schema-driven codec. Each `Player`/`Projectile` is an ordered
  field list indexing a per-entity dirty bitmask; a delta writes only changed fields, a keyframe
  writes all. Floats are quantized to f32, and the codec is *symmetric* (`quantizeSnapshot` =
  what the client decodes), so a delta-applied world equals a full-snapshot one bit-for-bit.
  Only players/projectiles are delta'd; tick/ack/events/pings ride in full (tiny).
- **Acked-baseline (Quake3) model** — the client piggybacks the newest tick it decoded on its
  input stream (`InputMsg.ackSnapshotTick`); the server (`net/serverSnapshots.ts`
  `SnapshotChannel`) delta-encodes the next snapshot against that baseline, or sends a keyframe
  when none is usable (fresh join / lost ack / aged-out / a ~60-broadcast periodic interval).
  Loss-robust: the client only acks what it holds, so the server only diffs against something
  decodable. Snapshots are WebSocket **binary** frames; control messages stay JSON **text**
  frames; the transport tells them apart by frame type.
- **Server CPU** — the old per-client `structuredClone` is gone: one shared snapshot is built
  from the live world and quantized **once** per broadcast (the next baseline), then encoded per
  client (O(players × clients) clone → one O(players) quantize).

M2.15 batches the **upstream** input stream (the counterpart to M2.13/M2.14 downstream). The client
no longer sends one framed message per 10ms tick (~100 msg/s); it coalesces a render frame's
tick-commands into **one datagram** and re-sends the newest few un-acked inputs for redundancy.
The seqs/stream are unchanged — only the wire packaging differs — so M2.3's fixed-tick model and
M2.4's replay are untouched. Pieces:
- **`InputMsg.inputs: SequencedInput[]`** — the wire message carries an array, not one command.
  `Transport.sendInput` is now batch-shaped; loopback enqueues each immediately (zero latency),
  the WebSocket sends one JSON frame per batch, and `SimulatedTransport` drops/jitters the
  datagram **as a unit** (the loss the redundancy is designed to survive).
- **`net/inputSender.ts`** (`InputSender`) — owns pacing + redundancy, kept out of the transports
  so loopback stays immediate and the policy is unit-testable. Driven from `main.ts` off the
  existing `ClientInputManager.unacked` ring: `produce()` still emits every tick, then the sender
  flushes `unacked.slice(-INPUT.redundantTicks)` once per `INPUT.sendIntervalMs`. Tunables in
  `config.INPUT` (`sendIntervalMs` default **16ms ≈ 60Hz ≈ per render frame**, `redundantTicks`
  default 10). **60Hz is deliberate:** at one datagram per frame the uplink adds ~0 latency vs the
  old per-tick send (inputs leave the same frame), while still cutting the message rate; ~30Hz is
  a config-only bandwidth trade that adds up to an interval of uplink latency.
- **Receive side is free** — `server/index.ts` loops `inputs.push` over `msg.inputs`; the existing
  `PlayerQueue` dedup (drops stale ≤ `lastProcessedSeq` and already-queued duplicates) makes the
  redundant overlap a no-op, so a dropped datagram is covered by the next with no round-trip /
  repeat-last hiccup. The overlay gained an **upstream** line: `up …/s  batch …  redund …`.

## Key constraints

- **No ECS library.** Plain arrays of structs + ordered system functions. ECS indirection fights snapshotting and determinism.
- **Entities stay plain data; behavior lives in systems.** Methods on entities make snapshotting harder.
- **UI is bitmap-font-in-Pixi, not DOM.** The original font PNGs are rendered via Pixi `BitmapText` to stay pixel-identical with the game art at any scale. A hidden DOM `<input>` handles text entry only.
- **Per-client snapshots from day one.** Even if first version sends everyone everything, the `serializeSnapshotFor(world, playerId)` seam must exist.
