/**
 * Deterministic client-side simulation of remote projectiles — M2.8.
 *
 * Through M2.6 *every other* player's bullets were drawn by lerping their
 * streamed snapshot positions (`interpolation.ts`, now removed). That produced
 * two artifacts unique to enemy fire: a bullet that bounced off a wall *between*
 * two snapshots was drawn as a straight line through the corner until the
 * post-bounce snapshot arrived (the "teleport"), and all enemy fire trailed by
 * the interpolation delay in a way that read as inferred rather than physical.
 *
 * The fix is the same determinism the local player (M2.4) and its own shots
 * (M2.6) already exploit, turned outward: a projectile's entire future is fixed
 * at spawn. `stepProjectile` (`sim/systems/projectiles.ts`) advances it from
 * *only* position, velocity, bounce count, and the map — **no player input drives
 * it** — so any client holding the spawn state can reproduce its path bit-for-bit,
 * bounces included. So instead of lerping streamed positions we take the latest
 * authoritative remote projectiles and **simulate them forward** to render time.
 *
 * Render time (the crux — roadmap M2.8): remote bullets are simulated to the
 * **same** render time as remote ships, `now − interpDelayMs`, *not* the true
 * present. Drawing them at present would require also extrapolating the remote
 * *ships* to present, which reintroduces the turn→overshoot→snap the roadmap
 * rejected in M2.2. Keeping bullets on the ships' timeline fixes the bounce-jump
 * without detaching a shot from the ship that fired it.
 *
 * This simulation is **cosmetic** — it only decides where a remote shot is *drawn*.
 * In the client-authoritative relay model the shot that actually *hits* you is
 * adjudicated by your own `LocalSim` (the defender), which holds each incoming shot
 * by this same interp delay so its hit test lines up with this drawn pose.
